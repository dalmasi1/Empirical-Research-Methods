	Description: Cleans and prepares the Census and ACS data for analysis, using 
		code adapted from replication package for Autor and Price (2013)
	
	Notes:
	- Start with IPUMS decennial Census extracts (1980, 1990, and 2000) 
		and pooled 3-year ACS extracts (2005-2007, 2008-2010, 2011-2013).
		Select the following variables (not all of them present in all 
		of these extracts): 
		year multyear perwt sex age uhrswork wkswork1 wkswork2 incwage
		educ educd classwkrd empstatd gqtyped occ occ1990 ind ind1990.
	- For the ACS 3-year extracts, set "year" equal to "multyear" and drop "multyear".

****Clean Census-ACS Data****

** Use Treiman file to aggregate DOT 1977 by Census Occupation 1990dd codes

* Load Treiman file, which is a sample of 1980 Census respondents double-coded
*	with 1970 and 1980 occupation codes
use "`dotdir'/treiman.dta", clear

* Create labor supply weights
gen lswt = hours * weeks

* Restrict to employed persons with observed occupation codes
keep if lswt > 0

* Merge in DOT 1977 measures with 1970 occupation codes
merge m:1 occ70 using "`dotdir'/dot77-70.dta", keep(match) nogen

* Collapse the DOT measures at the 1980 occupation level
collapse ehf finger dcp sts math [aweight=lswt], by(occ80)

* Merge in 1980 to 1990dd crosswalk
rename occ80 occ
merge 1:1 occ using "`occdir'/occ1980_occ1990dd_update.dta", nogen

* Collapse by occ1990dd
collapse ehf finger dcp sts math, by(occ1990dd)
